<p style="width: 100%; text-align: justify;">A game that illustrates some key ideas in our new work <i>Spatial planning 
with long visual range benefits escape from visual predators in complex naturalistic environments</i>.
German Espinosa created the game and Alex Lai made the artwork for it.<br>

Some key findings of the paper is that a combination of visual range and a certain level of habitat 
complexity&mdash;only occurring on land&mdash;creates a gradient of benefit for the evolution of brain circuitry
to plan. Open water, coral reef, and jungle all favor reactive mode decision making rather than planning.<br>

You are the prey. You move using the arrow keys on your keyboard, each key press moves you through the environment
with some speed (if you stop pressing a key, the prey will stop). In the <i>Easy</i> mode, despite having a visual
range you will be able to see a silhouette of the predator. In the <i>Natural</i> mode, the predator is only able to
see you when you see it. In the <i>Hard</i> mode and in the <i>Open Waters</i> environment, the predator always
sees you. If the predator sees you it will aggresively pursue you. The game is over when you reach the goal position
(middle-top) or when you get eaten.
