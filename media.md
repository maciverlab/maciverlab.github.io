### Algorithmic and Neural Basis of Decision Making 

A game that illustrates some key ideas in our new work _Spatial planning with long visual range benefits escape from visual predators in complex naturalistic environments_. German Espinosa created the game and Alex Lai made the artwork for it.  

Some key findings of the paper is that a combination of visual range and a certain level of habitat complexity&mdash;only occurring on land&mdash;creates a gradient of benefit for the evolution of brain circuitry to plan. Open water, coral reef, and jungle all favor reactive mode decision making rather than planning. 

You are the prey. You move using the arrow keys on your keyboard, each key press moves you through the environment with some speed (if you stop pressing a key, the prey will stop). In the _Easy_ mode, despite having a visual range you will be able to see a silhouette of the predator. In the _Natural_ mode, the predator is only able to see you when you see it. In the _Hard_ mode and in the _Open Waters_ environment, the predator always sees you. If the predator sees you it will aggresively pursue you. The game is over when you reach the goal position (middle-top) or when you get eaten.
