<p> Our research is centered around fish. Part of the lab is focused on  weakly electric fish <em>Apertonus albifrons</em> looking at active sensing, motion and agility for a detailed<br>
analysis of how the brain performs signal processing on sensory signals. The other part of the lab analyzes prey capture behavior and key midbrain circuits in larval zebra fish<br>
in collaboration with Prof. David McLean at Northwestern University to understand how brains process complex stimuli in the generation of motor programs.</p>
