<p>In the Interactive and Emergent Autonomy Lab, our research focuses on
    computational methods in data-driven control, information theory in
    physical systems, and embodied intelligence. We investigate how both
    autonomous systems and biological systems interact with their environments
    (and, in some cases, with each other) to learn and improve their behaviors.
    This work often involves mathematical modeling, development of new
    mathematical tools, algorithmic implementation and programming, and
    experimentation. </p>


  <p>Example projects include <a href="/projects/UnderwaterExploration">robotic exploration using electrosense</a>, <a href="/projects/HapticLanguages">robotic exploration using mechanical contact</a>,
    <a href="/projects/HumanSwarmCollaboration">human-in-the-loop control</a>, and <a href="/projects/SoftwareEnabledBiomedicalDevices">shared control for rehabilitation/assistive devices</a>.
    We also work in the field of <a href="/projects/AlgorithmicMatterAndEmergentComputation">algorithmic matter</a>, where we develop computational models to enable the design of microrobots with minimal actuation, sensing, and computation.</p>


  <p>Much of our work focuses on human-machine systems.
    In our human-swarm collaboration project, we develop
    algorithms that enable autonomy to automatically react
    to human sensory and perception needs to improve situational
    awareness; this is an example of <a href="/projects/CyberPhysicalSystems.html">cyber-physical systems</a> in
    uncertain environments, where we develop algorithms that
    help complex cyber-physical systems to anticipate future uncertainty.
    In collaboration with Northwestern's Physical Therapy and Human Movement
    Sciences Department, we investigate <a href="/projects/SoftwareEnabledBiomedicalDevices.html">human-machine interaction in biomedical devices</a>
    through developing interactive robotic systems
    that help improve human motor control through physical interaction.
    Many of our projects involve the development of mathematical models
    and algorithmic implementations to improve how people and autonomy interact.
