### Algorithmic and Neural Basis of Naturalistic Decision Making

<p style="text-align:justify" width="100%">When a situation affords a long latency between stimulus and response, 
deliberative behavioral control can be used to generate behavior that is strategic, variable, and hard to predict by an 
adversary. As this latency decreases, reactive control takes over and generates responses that are fast, less variable, and
easier to predict by an adversary. We can characterize deliberative behavioral control or planning as action choices that 
occur after internally simulating more than one action sequence and its respective consequences. Conversely, reactive control 
is a rapid stimulus-evoked response. A large amount of research suggests that these two decision making systems have different 
neural substrates. Interestingly, the similarities between the lamprey (jawless fish that preceded mammals by 560 million 
years) and mammalian neural system that is implicated in reflexive behavior suggests that reactive control evolved very early
on in the vertebrate evolution. In contrast, behavioral and neural evidence for planing and higher level cognition seems to 
only exist for mammals and birds. Evidence for planning is less clear for reptiles and amphibians, and similarly ambiguous or 
absent in fish.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify" width="100%">Assuming the apparent absence of plan-based decision making in fish and other 
early vertebrates is correct (and not simply due 
to a lack of study relative to terrestrial vertebrates), we can use the uneven distribution of higher level cognition to gain 
insight into why we only see this in (certain) animals.</p>
