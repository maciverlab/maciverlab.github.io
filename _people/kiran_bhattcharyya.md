Aversion and attraction are fundamental drives which produce a wide range of orienting behaviors 
in organisms with nervous systems. Moreover, vertebrate animals must control a large number of 
degrees of freedom (motor neurons -> muscles -> joints) in order to produce these behaviors 
fast enough to respond to stimuli. I'm interested in investigating how the nervous system 
handles this degree-of-freedom problem by studying the larval zebrafish on a behavioral and 
neural level as it responds to appetitive and aversive visual stimuli.
