title: Mechanics and Bio-Inspired Robotics of Fish Locomotion
---

Knifefish are highly maneuverable swimmers capable of navigating complex environments. The fish generate thrust by undulating an elongated ventral fin. We study the fin mechanics using motion capture of live fish, computational fluid dynamics, and bio-inspired robotics. Using these tools, we are uncovering the underlying principles of knifefish locomotion which can then be implemented into underwater robotics to enhance maneuverability.

(C) Schematic of the ribbon fin showing the wavelength (λ), angular fin amplitude (θ), ray oscillation frequency (f), and the robot body frame (surge, heave and sway).


By using a combination of computational modeling, a robotic knife fish, and measurements of animal swimming behavior to study “median/paired fin” swimming used by animals (e.g. cuttlefish, triggerfish, and rays), we provide quantitative evidence for optimal specific wavelength (OSW) performance criterion: ratio of the wavelength of an undulation to its mean amplitude. It was shown that adherence to the OSW was indpedently emerged within eight clades of animals in three different phyla, including vertebrates and invertebrates, encompassing over a thousand species.
