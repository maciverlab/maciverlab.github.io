The evolution of terrestrial vertebrates, starting around 385 million years ago, is an iconic moment in evolution that brings to mind images of fish transforming into four-legged animals. Here we show that this radical change in body shape was preceded by an equally dramatic change in sensory abilities, akin to transitioning from seeing over short distances in a dense fog to seeing over long distances on a clear day. Measurements of eye sockets and simulations of their evolution show that eyes nearly tripled in size just prior to vertebrates living on land. Computational simulations of these animal’s visual ecology show that for viewing objects through water, the increase in eye size provided a small increase in performance with diminishing returns, but viewing through air provided a very large increase with increasing returns. The jump in eye size was therefore unlikely to have arisen for seeing through water, and instead points to an unexpected hybrid of seeing through air while still primarily inhabiting water. Our results and several anatomical innovations arising at the same time suggest lifestyle similarity to crocodiles. The consequent combination of the increase in eye size and vision through air would have conferred a million-fold increase in the amount of space within which objects could be seen. The “buena vista” hypothesis our data suggests is that seeing opportunities from afar played a role in the subsequent evolution of fully terrestrial limbs, as well as the emergence of elaborated action sequences through planning circuits in the nervous system.
